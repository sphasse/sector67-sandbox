More details on the gcode specification can be found here:

http://www.linuxcnc.org/handbook/gcode/g-code.html

and

http://linuxcnc.org/docs/html/gcode_overview.html

The conversational format can be found partially described at:

http://www.anilam.com/Uploads/File/Training%20Presentation%20PDF%20Files/3000M_Training_2.pdf

and

In general since the code generated by this script will ultimately be used to move
a machine, the goal of this script is to accurately translate programs, and
to fail fast and accurately when that cannot be done.  As a result, some of the 
implementation (most notably convert_to_conversational) probably appears to
be implemented in a fairly brittle manner.  This is for the most part intentional.
Each command and variation handled is explicit, and other unknown commands result
in an error.

It is expected this script will have a few primary uses:

1) For converting programs that are larger than the Anilam 1100 can handle.  These
programs will then subsequently be drip fed to the mill.
2) To correctly translate gcode programs that use arcs with IJK coordinates
specified incrementally.  Although incremental IJK specification is the default
in gcode, the Anilam-based translator expects the IJK to be absolute.  Although
this translator is incomplete, it is superior in that respect.
3) To avoid multiple round-trips to the mill with floppy disks.

TODO:
* The gcode verifier could be greatly improved.  However, since the translation
is done rather explicitly, it is hoped this will not introduce any risk to the
translation process.
* Translations for some Anilam functions that have gcode equivalents:

peck drill
tool change

etc. are not implemented
